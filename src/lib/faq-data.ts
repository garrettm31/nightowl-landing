    question: "How does NightOwl answer my phone?",
    answer:
      "You get a dedicated local phone number, or you can forward your existing business line to NightOwl after hours. When a call comes in, our AI receptionist picks up instantly with your custom greeting.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it really sound human?",
    answer:
      "Yes. NightOwl uses the latest conversational voice AI. It handles interruptions, understands accents, and keeps responses concise. Most callers don't realize they're talking to an AI.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does appointment booking work?",
    answer:
      "NightOwl connects to your Google Calendar. When a caller wants to book, it checks your real availability, offers open slots, and creates a confirmed calendar event — all during the call.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if someone has an emergency?",
    answer:
      "NightOwl detects urgent situations and immediately directs callers to call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room. It never gives medical, legal, or financial advice.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize what NightOwl says?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. You set your greeting, business hours, appointment duration, and emergency message. NightOwl uses all of this to respond naturally and accurately.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if the AI makes a mistake or says something wrong?",
    answer:
      "NightOwl texts you a summary after every single call — caller name, what was discussed, and any booking it made. You always have full visibility. If something looks off, you can follow up with the client directly. The AI only books slots that exist in your calendar, so it can't double-book or invent availability.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my clients know they're talking to an AI?",
    answer:
      "Most don't ask, and NightOwl sounds natural enough that many callers don't notice. If a client asks directly, NightOwl is honest — it will tell them it's an automated assistant. It never pretends to be a human employee. That said, clients mostly care that someone answered and their appointment got booked.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I want to cancel?",
    answer:
      "No contracts, no cancellation fees. Cancel anytime from your dashboard. Your account stays active through the end of your billing period.",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of businesses use NightOwl?",
    answer:
      "Barber shops and solo barbers are our most common customers — NightOwl fits naturally into a one-chair or multi-chair shop. We also serve nail salons, dental offices, law firms, medical practices, veterinary clinics, and any small business that gets calls after hours.",
